## üìë Overview

A _prime number_ is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. In other words, a _prime number_ is a whole number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For example:

_2_ is a _prime number_ because its only positive divisors are _1_ and _2_.
_3_ is a _prime number_ for the same reason.
_4_ is not a _prime number_ because it can be divided by _1_, _2_, and _4_.
_5_ is a _prime number_ because its only positive divisors are _1_ and _5_.
_Prime numbers_ play a fundamental role in number theory and have applications in various areas of mathematics and computer science, such as cryptography. The process of finding _prime numbers_ and studying their properties is an important topic in mathematics.

## ‚è≥ TLDR;

A _prime number_ is a natural number greater than _1_ that has no positive divisors other than _1_ and itself. Examples include _2_, _3_, _5_, and _7_.
