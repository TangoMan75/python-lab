Hello World

#beginner #print #string

## 📑 Overview

_"Hello, World!"_ is a traditional first program often used in programming tutorials to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language.
The program simply outputs or prints the `string` _"Hello, World!"_ to the screen.
The idea is to demonstrate how to write a minimal working program in a given programming language.

## 📚 Implementation Details

1. The purpose of the `HelloWorld` class is to print out the text _"Hello world!"_.
2. It does not take any inputs.
3. It produces the output `string` _"Hello world!"_.
4. It achieves this by defining a class called `HelloWorld` with a method called `helloWorld` that returns the `string` _"Hello world!"_.
5. The key logic flow is:

    - The `HelloWorld` class is defined
    - The `helloWorld` method is defined inside the class
    - When `helloWorld` is called, it returns the `string` _"Hello world!"_

## ⏳ TLDR;

So in summary, the `HelloWorld` class encapsulates the logic for printing _"Hello world!"_ into a simple reusable class.
By defining a class with a method that returns this `string`, the code allows printing _"Hello world!"_ by calling `HelloWorld->helloWorld()`.
The class abstracts away the implementation details of how the `string` is generated and printed.
