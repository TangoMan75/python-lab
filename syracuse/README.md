#recursion

## 📑 Overview

The _Syracuse Conjecture_, also known as the _Collatz Conjecture_, proposes that for any positive integer, if it is even, divide it by two, and if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one, and repeat this process.
The conjecture suggests that no matter what number you start with, this sequence will eventually reach _1_ and then continue cycling between _1_ and _4_.
It's an unsolved problem in mathematics.

The Syracuse algorithm takes a positive integer _n_ as input and repeatedly applies the following operation:

- If _n_ is even, divide it by _2_
- If _n_ is odd, multiply it by _3_ and add _1_

The algorithm stops when _n_ reaches _1_.

For example, if the input is 5, the steps would be:

```
5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
```

So for input _5_, the Syracuse algorithm reaches _1_ in _5_ steps.

## 📚 Implementation Details

The `syracuse` function in the `Syracuse` class takes an `integer` number as input.
The number must be greater than or equal to _1_, otherwise it will throw an exception.

It returns an `array` containing the sequence of numbers generated by the _Syracuse algorithm_ when starting with the input number.

The core logic is that if the current number is even, it divides it by two.
If it is odd, it multiplies it by _3_ and adds _1_.
This new number then becomes the current number for the next iteration.

It uses a recursive algorithm, calling `syracuse` repeatedly while passing in the new current number.
Each iteration appends the new number onto the output `array`.

This repeats until the current number becomes _1_, at which point the recursion stops and the `array` is returned.

## ⏳ TLDR;

So in summary, it takes a starting integer, runs it through the Syracuse algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers, and returns that full sequence in an array.
The purpose is to demonstrate the Syracuse Conjecture and generate the number sequence for any given starting integer.
